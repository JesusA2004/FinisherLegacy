 * Checks whether a static asset actually exists, without ever rendering a

 * guaranteed-reliable CSS/component fallback and only swap to a real
 * photo/video once this confirms it — never the other way around (render
 * the real asset optimistically and swap to fallback on @error), because
 * that pattern flashes/races depending on network timing, which is exactly
 * the bug this replaces (the Legacy Code and plate sections would
 * sometimes show the CSS scene and sometimes an empty/broken state).
 *
 * Uses a HEAD request rather than `new Image()` so it works for video
 * sources too, not just images.
